# Useful Scripts for Google Earth Engine

_A repo for useful Google Earth Engine scripts, written in either Python or Javascript._

Scripts:

* Javascript:
  * [preprocessing.js](/javascript/preprocessing.js)
    * **combineModis** combine MODIS Terra and Aqua into one dataset.

HOW TO USE:

* For most functions, just copy paste to the GEE editor or Python editor depending on the language. 
* Another way to use is by linking functions using [GEE Script Modules](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground).
